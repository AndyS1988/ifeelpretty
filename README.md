Project in process
***
Creating a React Web App for a local beauty salon. 
***
For better SEO results I am using react-router & react-helmet
***
There are still few tasks that need to be done: 
	* Pretify Components
	* Remove repeated CSS
	* REVISION (code, text, info)
	* Optimize all images
	* Fix the links to divs (react-router)
