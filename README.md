Project in process
***
Creating a React Web App for a local beauty salon. 
***
For better SEO results I am using react-router & react-helmet
***
There are still few tasks that need to be done: 
	- Remove repeated CSS (create classes),
	- REVISION (code, text, info),
	- Optimize all images,
	- Fix the links to divs (react-router),
	- Cross Browser Compatibility
